'\n    jinja2.bccache\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    This module implements the bytecode cache system Jinja is optionally\n    using.  This is useful if you have very complex template situations and\n    the compiliation of all those templates slow down your application too\n    much.\n\n    Situations where this is useful are often forking web applications that\n    are initialized on the first request.\n\n    :copyright: (c) 2010 by the Jinja Team.\n    :license: BSD.\n'
