'\nThe naming convention for ServiceAdvisor subclasses depends on whether they are\nin common-services or are part of the stack version\'s services.\n\nIn common-services, the naming convention is <service_name><service_version>ServiceAdvisor.\nIn the stack, the naming convention is <stack_name><stack_version><service_name>ServiceAdvisor.\n\nUnlike the StackAdvisor, the ServiceAdvisor does NOT provide any inheritance.\nIf you want to use inheritance to augment a previous version of a service\'s\nadvisor you can use the following code to dynamically load the previous advisor.\nSome changes will be need to provide the correct path and class names.\n\n  SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n  PARENT_DIR = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, \'../<old_version>\')\n  PARENT_FILE = os.path.join(PARENT_DIR, \'service_advisor.py\')\n\n  try:\n    with open(PARENT_FILE, \'rb\') as fp:\n      service_advisor = imp.load_module(\'service_advisor\', fp, PARENT_FILE, (\'.py\', \'rb\', imp.PY_SOURCE))\n  except Exception as e:\n    traceback.print_exc()\n    print "Failed to load parent"\n\n  class <NewServiceAdvisorClassName>(service_advisor.<OldServiceAdvisorClassName>)\n\nwhere the NewServiceAdvisorClassName and OldServiceAdvisorClassName follow the naming\nconvention listed above.\n\nFor examples see: common-services/HAWQ/2.0.0/service_advisor.py\nand common-services/PXF/3.0.0/service_advisor.py\n'
