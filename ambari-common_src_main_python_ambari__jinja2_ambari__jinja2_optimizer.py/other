"\n    ambari_jinja2.optimizer\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    The jinja optimizer is currently trying to constant fold a few expressions\n    and modify the AST in place so that it should be easier to evaluate it.\n\n    Because the AST does not contain all the scoping information and the\n    compiler has to find that out, we cannot do all the optimizations we\n    want.  For example loop unrolling doesn't work because unrolled loops would\n    have a different scoping.\n\n    The solution would be a second syntax tree that has the scoping rules stored.\n\n    :copyright: (c) 2010 by the Jinja Team.\n    :license: BSD.\n"
