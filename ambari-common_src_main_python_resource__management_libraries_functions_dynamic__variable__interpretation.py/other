'\nThis file provides helper methods needed for the versioning of RPMs. Specifically, it does dynamic variable\ninterpretation to replace strings like {{ hdp_stack_version }} and {{ component_version }} where the value of the\nvariables cannot be determined ahead of time, but rather, depends on what files are found.\n\nIt assumes that {{ hdp_stack_version }} is constructed as ${major.minor.patch.rev}-${build_number}\nE.g., 998.2.2.1.0-998\nPlease note that "-${build_number}" is optional.\nWhereas {{ component_version }} is up to the Component to define, may be 3.0.1 or 301.\n'
