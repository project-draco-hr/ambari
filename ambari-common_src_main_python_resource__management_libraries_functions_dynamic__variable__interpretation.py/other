'\nThis file provides helper methods needed for the versioning of RPMs. Specifically, it does dynamic variable\ninterpretation to replace strings like {{ stack_version_formatted }}  where the value of the\nvariables cannot be determined ahead of time, but rather, depends on what files are found.\n\nIt assumes that {{ stack_version_formatted }} is constructed as ${major.minor.patch.rev}-${build_number}\nE.g., 998.2.2.1.0-998\nPlease note that "-${build_number}" is optional.\n'
